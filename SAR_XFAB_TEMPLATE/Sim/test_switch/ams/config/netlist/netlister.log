INFO (VLOGNET-60): The stimulus name mapped table will not be printed in the

"/home/ics15/ICS_ADC_PROJECT_26/SAR_XFAB_TEMPLATE/Sim/test_switch/ams/config/netlist/digital/testfixture.verilog" file. To print the stimulus name mapped
table, set 
simVerilogPrintStimulusNameMappingTable = t either in CIW or the
.simrc file 
before invoking Verilog netlister.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-62): Database internal net names will be printed for floating
instance ports. To prevent 
them from being printed, set

the .simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-64): All cellviews in the design will be printed in the Netlist
Configuration list. 
If you want to print only those cellviews that need to be
re-netlisted in the 
list, set simVerilogIncrementalNetlistConfigList = t either
in CIW or the 
.simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-68): The initial state of stimulus of all inout pins is set to

either in CIW or the .simrc file.
